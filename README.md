# Framer Motion Showcase with Next.js

## Objective

Explore the integration of animations in a Next.js application using Framer Motion. You'll create a simple application that displays three images with engaging animations to demonstrate your understanding of animation effects and their implementation in web development.

## Project Structure

This project is a simple showcase of integrating animations into a Next.js application using Framer Motion. It features three animated components, each displaying an image with engaging animations. The animations include scaling up on hover, rotating, and fading in on while in view (scrolling).

### Components

#### MountainView.jsx

Displays a mountain view image with a scaling animation on hover.

#### Cityscape.jsx

Displays a cityscape image with a rotating animation on hover.

#### ForestPath.jsx

Displays a forest path image with a fading in animation on load or scroll in view.

## Deployment

This project was deployed on netlify:

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the integration of animations using Framer Motion in a Next.js application. By following the provided instructions, I learned how to create engaging animations to enhance user experience on my web applications.
